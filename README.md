## Download

H : Toggle UI

## Window Size

The window is resizeable which means that it can have a different aspect ratio than the Augmenta Area aspect ratio.
This won't change the data output, it is only a visual change.

## Zeroconf

For the simulator to create a Zeroconf service on Windows, you need to have Apple Bonjour for Windows installed.
