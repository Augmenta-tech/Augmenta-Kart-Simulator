## How to use ?

In UI : 

1 - Set resolution

2 - Set the point number

3 - Set the OSC data output

## Information

To toggle the UI press "h".

The window is resizeable which means that it can have a different aspect ratio than the area aspect ratio in which Augmenta works.
This won't change the data output, it is only a visual change.
