# Augmenta-Simulator
Work without Augmenta hardware by simulating people moving in space.
This space size is in pixel, which corresponds to the video output resolution.

## How to use ?

1 - Set resolution

2 - Set the point number

3 - Receive your data in your Augmenta Unity project

## Information
The window is resizeable which means that you can have a different aspect ratio than the area aspect ratio in which Augmenta works.
This won't change the data output, it is only a visual change.

## Version
Current : 2.1.1
Unity : 2018.1.1f1
